This repository contains three simple Python scripts showcasing basic loop operations:

    50-times.py: Prints "YOUR NAME" 50 times using a loop.
    from-To.py: Prints numbers from 1000 to 9555, incrementing by 10 in each iteration.
    name.py: Displays the user's name character by character in an incremental pattern using loops.

These scripts demonstrate the use of loops, len() function, and string slicing in Python.
